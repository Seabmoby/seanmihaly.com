Prior to the announcement of the Kickstarter, Sean was put in charge of developing the logo along with the general aesthetic for The Chromatic Dragon brand. The owners descirbed taking the look and feel of a medieval pub one would see in The Lord of The Rings or Game of Thrones, and putting a modern, contemporary spin on it.

Upon agreement on the logo, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/gamerpubsav/">the Facebook page</a> along with other social outlets were created in addition to the <a target="_blank" href="http://chromaticdragon.com/">the official website.</a> Soon after, the menu was developed which allowed for the physical creation of the menu to take place. Additionally, Sean created fliers using photographs he had taken to distribute to places in the community, and on the campus.
