The Chromatic Dragon is a restaurant and bar in Savannah, GA built and designed for gamers, nerds, and their families. The idea of a 'gamerpub' wasn't new at the time of conception, but there certainly wasn't anything like it in Savannah before it. Within the same block, another business called The Guild Hall housed a similar demographic of people who spend their time and money on gaming-related hobbies such as Magic The Gathering, Dungeons and Dragons, various board games, and video games. The owners and founders of The Guild Hall looked to build a gaming campus, with The Chromatic Dragon being their fuel station for local gamers and their families alike. 

In Janurary of 2015, The Chromatic Dragon <a target="_blank" href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/theguildhall/the-chromatic-dragon-your-neighborhood-gamer-pub">launched its Kickstarter</a> to raise money for the renovation and decking-out of the space. 

Sean was in charge of directing, filming, and editing the Kickstarter video seen below:
