Intro: 

----

Text: I am a strategic thinker with a goal to bring better interactive experiences to websites, apps, and games. By creating user experiences that are designed with intelligent standards of usability, I bring products to market that center around best practices in user-focused designs. I am proficient in the Adobe Creative Cloud, HTML/CSS, and Atlassian Jira, and I use those tools along with many others, along with my skills in project management, to deliver the most effective UI/UX solutions for teams and businesses.
