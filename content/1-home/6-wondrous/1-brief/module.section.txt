*Wondrous* is an immersive interactive installation that will enchant users. Flying kites
is a century-old tradition that has an international and ageless appeal. The kites will
evoke childhood memories and bring the user to a happy yet serene place.
*Wondrous* allows users who step within the installation to control their very
own digital kite. The serene starry night sky will be projected on the ceiling, giving
the user the feeling that they are outside. Using input from the Kinect along with
Processing software, the user will be tracked and represented with a kite on the
screen that will be projected on the ceiling. Each user will have their own kite and as
they move around the kite will follow them, much like a user would control a kite in
the sky. If the user hovers their kite over a star that star will disappear but begin to
form a constellation. There are a series of constellations in the sky that correspond
with the twelve zodiac symbols.

*Wondrous* is an interactive installation that will bring users a sense of peace and
happiness. Kites have an ageless and international appeal that will bring users back
to a happier time. The whimsical nature of *Wondrous* will allow the users to not only
interact with the environment, but also with each other.

*Wondrous* is an expandable environment that can cater to multiple users. Based on
the space that we have been given, we are limited to the amount of users. Ideally six
users yields the best results, but the system can handle up to 10. Also with only using
a single Kinect we are limited as well.

*Wondrous* won the award for "Best Interactive Installation" in 2014 in Savannah, GA.

Sean's role on the *Wonderous* project was that of a project manager and lead designer. Sean was part of a group of designers and programmers tasked with delievering an interactive piece in ten weeks. As a group, the design for the installation was formed, presented, and executed within this time. Along the way, Sean was responsible for managing a group of approximately 10 designers in both visual and auditory fields, along with programmers responsible for writing the Processing (java) code.
